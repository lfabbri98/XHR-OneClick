#However, you have to specify also the files you want to import, in this case all the files in format .dat will be imported
#This is achieved with the string /*.dat
# Please note that the /\ depends on the operative system --> \:Windows and /:Linux and Mac
# Change your paths according to them

#For yes/no choices use the correct syntax otherwise the program does not work correctly
